						<p>NBA teams scored an average of 114.6 <span class="item-title">points per game</span> this season, the highest mark since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>While many factors contribute to the scoring trend, a big one is this: The league’s elite players are scoring more than ever. The <span class="item-top"> top 20%</span> of NBA scorers combined to average a record 22.8 points per game this year.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>That record also makes for the largest-ever scoring gap between the <span class="item-top">top</span> and <span class="item-bottom">bottom</span> group of scorers.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>The top players’ scoring outburst is fueled in part by the ongoing NBA love affair with <span class="item-title">three-point shots</span>. The <span class="item-top">top 20% of scorers</span> hit more threes this year than any other season in history.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="5">
						<p>All that scoring has not come at the cost of creating plays for teammates. At nearly five <span class="item-title">assists per game</span>, <span class="item-top">top scorers</span> are creating shots for teammates at a record level.</p>
