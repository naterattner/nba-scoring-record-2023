						Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

						It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

						<p>NBA teams scored an average of 114.6 points per game this season, the highest mark since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>While many factors contribute to the scoring trend, a big one is this: The league’s elite players are scoring more than ever. The top 20% of NBA players combined to average a record 22.8 points per game this year.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>That record also makes for the largest-ever scoring gap between the top group of players and the bottom group of players.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>The top players’ scoring outburst is fueled in part by the ongoing NBA love affair with three-point shots. The top 20% of players hit more threes this year than any other season in history.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="5">
						<p>All that scoring has not come at the cost of creating plays for teammates. At nearly five assists/game, top scorers are creating shots for teammates at a record level.</p>
